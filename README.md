Personal website
url from gitHub itslef should be the only trusted url,
Even if you set "homepage" in package.json always check what github stored as a url. 
if it is different because of a custom domain or something ex. https://github.optum.com/pages/aali66/optum-header/
always take it from github website back to package.json
ex. 
replace
https://github.optum.com/pages/aali66/aali66.github.optum.io/optum-header
with
https://github.optum.com/pages/aali66/optum-header/

or you could have used the correct value from the beginning
